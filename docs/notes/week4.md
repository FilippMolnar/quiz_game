### _16:10_ Tasks for next week
* Put questions in database and select 20 questions at the start of every game.
* Create workflow of starting a game, answering questions, etc.
* Start with multiplayer games (create game id and websocket groups).

### _16:15_ Assignments to do
* There are no more assignments to do.

### _16:16_ HCI report feedback
* Follow the Information Literacy in the HCI report (e.g. use references).
* Adding the original design would be nice to see improvement.
* Demographic should be _timeless_: "People who just got into x" instead of "First year students"
* Procedure should be more elaborate. Explanation of method execution should be added.
* Consider changing environment (e.g. let the test group look at the design multiple times and increase question difficulty every time).
* Reflect on the feedback: do we (dis)agree? Why?
* Run another user experiment to see if the improvements created any other problems.
* How did we choose the evaluators?
* Don't mix up the demographics. Stay within the set demographics, unless you decide on diverse demographics.
* As long as you know how to do something, it doesn't matter whether you actually do it.

**References**\
Why x amount of people? Where did we get this? Everything that isn't referenced is our own claim.

### _16:25_ Feedback on issue template
The template is fine, but we have to add it to the code of conduct.

### _16:28_ Merge requests and commit feedback
* We have to make sure everyone participates in reviews and the work should be balanced.
* We have to review every merge request except the agenda.
* Weeks end 24 hours before the meeting.

### _16:30_ Demo

### _16:34_ Testing
"If it's not tested, it's not done"
* Try to keep the test coverage as high as possible, but UI does not have to be tested by code. Instead, it should be tested manually. These tests have to be documented.
* _Mocking_ is not in the scope of this course, so don't bother.
* The pipeline can be changed to ignore UI tests. This will result in more accurate test coverage.
* Try to do the testing as soon as possible.

### _16:37_ Buddy check
Deadline is next week (exam week) friday and it is **mandatory**.
You give feedback on everyone (including yourself).
It includes two questions: one (open) for everybody to see, one (closed) just for the TA and the staff.
If you're uncomfortable about anything, approach the TA as soon as possible.

### _16:40_ General
During the exam week it is not necessary to have a meeting.
We have to send a table with the times everyone is available.

### _16:41_ Side notes
* It is okay to change issues on the go, but we should try to make them all adhere to the template. Closed issues should not be changed.
* Issues that are already solved before an issue was made should be traced back so an issue can be added.

### _16:42_ Meeting concluded
