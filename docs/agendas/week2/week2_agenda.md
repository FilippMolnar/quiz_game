In italics, you will find some additional explanations of the agenda points. You will find mostly the same points in the next agendas.

# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*
- Assignment 2B
- Get feedback for the backlog
- Make sure you have a Mattermost channel (your TA will create one for you)
- Create a planning and put it on GitLab
    - Implement all items on the todo list
- Discuss a cake rule: If you are late or not there at all, you have to bring cake (or something similar)
- Things to research:
    - Git (see lecture 2)
        - discuss branch names
        - discuss when to merge with main
    - Code structure (see lecture 4)
        - How will you use packages?
        - What will your code structure look like? (UML)
        - Decide on line endings
    - IDE
        - IntelliJ

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
* How to use scrum?
* Make sure I am in the mattermost group
* Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*


# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*

# Minutes

### 14:53 Backlog
Should be updated after the second Q&A. More specific, concrete description of program (able to derive issues from it).

### 14:56 Code of Conduct
Two meetings per week.

### 14:58 Code Structure

- Izzy found a generalized Git command for using the same line break.
- We will use Camel Case. Tabs instead of spaces.

### 15:00 Git & Branch Naming
Dev branch + another branch for creating new features. Merge independent branch with dev, test and then with main (if stable). Two people must approve each merge request.

### 15:04 Design
Design is a priority. It will be added to the Code of Conduct.

### 15:08 Discussion of motivations and work style.
